What does TypeRocket Do?
==========

TypeRocket makes coding advanced WordPress themes a blast. Get custom fields for post types, taxonomies, comments, option pages, user profiles and even on the front-end inside theme template files. You can access a number of pre-made TypeRocket plugins, we have those too, for features like SEO and sliders installed directly into your theme.

Designer? TypeRocket we designed with you in mind. We take care of knowing what WordPress hooks to use so you can with 1 line of code have a post type with a custom icon of your choice. With 1 more and get a metabox. Another and you have a custom taxonomy. Custom fields are just as easy to add.

Developer? TypeRocket is OOP and takes advantage some cool design patterns. Ripped up documentation, videos classes you will love including extensible fields.
